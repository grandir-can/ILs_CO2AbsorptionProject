# ILs_CO2AbsorptionProject
## About
This is the code for paper "Multiple ensemble graph neural networks for the high-throughput screening of ionic liquids for carbon capture: Modeling study and experimental validation"<br>
In this study, five GNN models, including MPNN, GAT, GIN, PNA, and Attentive FP, were developed to predict the CO₂ absorption capacity and viscosity of ILs. To further enhance predictive accuracy, four ensemble strategies, namely ORSA, WA, stacking ensemble based on LR (stack_LR), and stacking ensemble based on ET (stack_ET), were implemented. Furthermore, traditional ML models, including XGBoost and random forest (RF), paired with classic molecular descriptors (RDKit descriptors and Morgan fingerprints), were benchmarked to contextualize the advantages of the GNN ensemble frameworks.
